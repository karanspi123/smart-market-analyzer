“What exactly do you want this model to do in a real-world trading setup?”

🔍 Questions:
	1.	What will this model output?
	•	☐ Predict next 15-min Close price
	•	☐ Predict direction (up/down) of next bar
	•	☐ Predict range (High-Low)
	•	☐ Signal a Buy/Sell/Hold decision
	2.	How do you plan to use this model in trading?
	•	☐ Run every 15 min to guide discretionary trading
	•	☐ Automate trades based on it
	•	☐ Filter setups manually
	•	☐ Use as input to a broader strategy (e.g., multi-timeframe logic)
	3.	**What’s your desired outcome per trade?
	•	☐ Gain 2 points on MES per signal
	•	☐ Win 60% of the time with 1.5R:1R risk/reward
	•	☐ Reduce false breakouts

Let’s solidify the target.

📦 Phase 2: Data Scope & Strategy Design

Let’s refine the dataset that your model will consume.

🔍 Questions:
	4.	What timeframe is your model trained on?
	•	✅ 15-minute
	•	Do you want to include other timeframes like 1H or daily as secondary features?
	5.	What years of data do you have?
	•	✅ You mentioned 6 years — do you have:
	•	☐ Continuous contract (MES ##-##)?
	•	☐ Adjusted for splits/rollovers?
	6.	Do you want to predict regular trading hours (RTH) only, or full 24h session?
	•	☐ 9:30 AM–4:00 PM EST (RTH)
	•	☐ Full Globex (00:00–23:59 EST)
	•	This affects volume, volatility, and noise levels significantly.

🧠 Phase 3: Feature Engineering and Predictive Logic

You’re interested in how price behaves relative to EMA9, EMA21, EMA220 and Volume.

🔍 Questions:
	7.	What relationships do you want the model to learn?
	•	☐ Mean reversion: “Price tends to return to EMA21”
	•	☐ Momentum: “If price is above all EMAs with increasing volume, it will keep going”
	•	☐ Compression: “When EMAs are tight, big moves follow”
	•	☑ Custom logic?
	8.	Do you want the model to learn candle structure too?
	•	☐ Include Open/High/Low
	•	☐ Add range, body size, wick ratios?
	•	☐ Include last X candle types (e.g., engulfing, doji, inside bar)?
	9.	Do you want to include trend direction based on slope of EMA?
	•	☐ Yes — we can add EMA21 slope, EMA220 slope
	•	☐ Use trend angle as numeric input

📈 Phase 4: Label Engineering (What You Train Toward)

🔍 Questions:
	10.	How do we define a “good prediction”?

	•	☐ Absolute price (regression)
	•	☐ Classification into buckets (e.g., ↑, ↓, no move)
	•	☐ Predict if Close > EMA in next bar
	•	☐ Predict if breakout will hold

	11.	How far ahead are you trying to predict?

	•	✅ Next 15-minute candle?
	•	☐ Next 2-3 candles?
	•	☐ Trend continuation over next 1 hour?

	12.	What’s the minimum movement you care about?

	•	☐ 0.25 point (1 tick)
	•	☐ 1.0 point
	•	☐ Only large moves (> 5 point swings)

This affects whether we use classification thresholds (e.g., up only if > 0.1%).

💸 Phase 5: Trading Considerations

🔍 Questions:
	13.	Do you want risk management built in?

	•	☐ Max daily drawdown
	•	☐ Max position size
	•	☐ Filter trades during high volatility

	14.	Do you want the model to avoid trading during news?

	•	☐ Yes, use economic calendar integration
	•	☐ No, learn through volatility

	15.	Will you paper trade this or connect to live orders (IBKR/NinjaTrader)?

	•	☐ Simulation only
	•	☐ Live trading via API

🎯 Final Build Plan (after your answers)

Once you respond to these questions, I’ll generate:
	•	✅ Clean data_service.py based on what you want
	•	✅ Custom model_service.py for regression or classification
	•	✅ Streamlined main.py
	•	✅ Clear backtesting or inference script to evaluate next steps
